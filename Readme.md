# Social Network NoSql

## Description
Challenge 18 requires us to use Insomnia to test a series of different GETS, POSTS, PUTS, and DELETE routes. We’ll be adding users and friends to our social network, along with testing the thoughts and reactions that each user can post. We’ll be updating those users, thoughts, and reactions, along with deleting all 3, as well. 

Last, but not least, we’ll be testing the delete routes for all of the above. We will be able to delete users, friends, thoughts, and reactions. When all tests are done, we’ll know that from a backend perspective, we have a working social network!
